# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a deep learning approach. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to distinguish between the two animal categories with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
- **Dataset**: Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized before feeding into the CNN model.
- **Model Architecture**: A custom CNN architecture was built, designed specifically for image classification tasks.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained with the Cats vs Dogs dataset using multiple epochs, batch normalization, and other optimizations.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of 83.91% on the test set.
- **Loss**: 0.7179.
